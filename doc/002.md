## 3.1 Flogo Apps in TIBCO Cloud Integration ##

In this lab you'll implement a process API that creates a qotation, by first invoking the system API that gets a rate from the pricing engine, then invoking a system API that create a quotation in Salesforce.

You will first create a "skeleton" Flogo app from the **Quotation** API specification. Then you will implement the flow with the system API and salesforce calls, to finally push the Flogo app and test it.

### 3.1.1 Getting Ready ###

To be able to create the "skeleton" Flogo app from the **Quotation** API specification, do the following:

1. Navigate to the API specifications by clicking on the **API Specs** menu item.
2. Select the group you've created the **Quotation** API specification in, e.g. **MyTCIWorkshop**.
3. Your screen should look similar to:

    ![Quotation API Spec](images/quotation_api_spec_flogo.png)
    
#### Set up Salesforce connection ####

From TIBCO Cloud home page, navigate to _Integration_ hexagon, then _Integration Apps_ section.

Go to _Connections_ tab.

![Connections](images/add_connection.png)

Click on add connection 
Type Salesforce in the search field and click on **Salesforce Connector**

### 3.1.2 How to Do It: Create the Skeleton Flogo App from the API Specification ###

To create a "skeleton" Flogo app from the **Quotation** API specification, do the following:

1. Go to the _Apps_ tab

2. Click on Create/Import button on the page's upper left

    ![Create App](images/create_import.png)
    
3. Choose/Clik Flogo from the pop-up left menu, then click on the _create New App_ button

4. Change the name of the app by typing the new name in the upper-right side of the screen. _(Spaces are not allowed in the app name)_

    ![Change app name](images/change_name.png)
    
5. Click on the _Create_ button to create your first flow/API

6. To create the skeleton app from the API specification, select _Swagger Specification_ from the pop-up left menu _(under start with section)_

7. Here, you can either upload your specification file, or use specifications modelled on TIBCO Cloud. Let's use the _Quotation API_ specification we just created. Select it and click on _Create_
    
     <img src="images/create_from_spec.png" alt="Create skeleton app from swagger specification" width="600">

8. The skeleton app is now created with the input/output of each method populated. Your screen should look like this:

     <img src="images/skeleteon_app.png" alt="skeleton app created" width="900">


### 3.1.3 How to Do It: Implement the Flogo App ###

In this lab, you'll create a process API that creates a quotation by making calls to the system API (Pricing Engine) and to salesforce using _Flogo Connector for Salesforce_. The address of first system API call is provided below. 


To implement the API business logic, do the following:

1. Click on the _postQuotation_POST_ flow.

2. To enable data to flow between the trigger and the flow, you first need to map the trigger output to the flow input, and flow data to the trigger reply. Click on the ![Flogo Trigger](images/flogo_trigger.jpg) icon to open the configuration of the **ReceiveHTTPMessage** trigger.

    <img src="images/configure_http_receiver.png" alt="Configure http receiver" width="500">

3. Map the trigger output to the flow input as follows:

    ![Trigger Ouput](images/trigger_output.png)

4. Map the flow data to the trigger reply as follows:

    ![Trigger Reply](images/trigger_reply.png)

5. Close the trigger configuration screen, and move the **Return** tile at least 3 positions to the right. 

    ![Trigger Reply](images/move_tiles.gif)

6. Create a first activity, by clicking on the left-most `+` and navigate through **General > Invoke REST Service**. Configure this activity as follows:

    1. Give it a name: **GetRate**.
    2. In the **Settings** section, specify the following fields:

        | Field         | Value           |
        | ------------- | --------------- |
        | Method  | GET |
        | URL | `https://eu-west-1.integration.cloud.tibcoapps.com:443/ecdqf65m3vtc2xkldj3mepxllqjswpjb/Engine-rate/engine/rate` |
        | Use certificate for verification | `false` |

    3. In the input settings section, add a parameter in the query params listing. Name it **year** and make it of type **number**
    ![Add query parameter](images/get-rate-input-params.png)
    4. In the **Input** section, create the following mapping:

        | Activity Input | Upstream Output |
        | -------------  | --------------- |
        | `queryParams.year` | `$flow.body["birth-year"]` |
	
	![Add query parameter](images/github_flogo_mapping.gif)

    4. In the **Output Settings** section, ensure the **Response Type** is set to `application/json`, and copy the following json structure into the **Response Schema**:

        ```json
        {
  			"rate-per-month": 105,
  			"rate-per-year": 1234
		}
        ```

        | -------------  | --------------- |
        | input/Quotation__c/records | array.forEach(array.create("one item array")) |
        | FullName__c | string.concat($flow.body["first-name"]," ", $flow.body["last-name"]) |
        | Email__c | $flow.body.email |
        | Yearly_Price__c | $activity[GetRate].responseBody["rate-per-year"] |
        | Monthly_Price__c | $activity[GetRate].responseBody["rate-per-month"] |
        | Broker_Organisation__c | $flow.body.broker |
        | Phone_Number__c | $flow.body.phone|

	4. **Save** and close the activity.

	    | To | string.concat("+33", string.substringAfter($flow.body.phone, "0")) |
	    | Body | string.concat("Bonjour,\n Suite Ã  votre demande de devis, nous avons le plaisir de vous communiquer un tarif annuel de ", coerce.toString($activity[GetRate].responseBody["rate-per-year"]), ".\n Le service MyCompany")|

9. Close the activity configuration screen, and create an additional activity, by clicking on the next `+` and navigate through **General > Configure HTTP Response**. Configure this activity as follows:

    1. In the **Settings** section, pick code 200 from pick list
    2. In the **Input** section, create the mapping for the following fields:

        | Field         | Value           |
        | ------------- | --------------- |
        | input/body/price-per-year  | $activity[GetRate].responseBody["rate-per-year"] |
        | input/body/price-per-month | $activity[GetRate].responseBody["rate-per-month"] |

    
10. Close the activity configuration screen, and configure the **Return** activity as follows:
