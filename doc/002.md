# 3. Build and Deploy Your API #

In this section you'll push an app implemented in BusinessWorks from Business Studio to TIBCO Cloud. Functionally, the app implements a system API that gets purchase orders from SAP Hana.

After that you'll create a Flogo app that implements a process API that creates sales orders, by first invoking the system API that gets a purchase order from SAP Hana, then invoking a system API that gets contact details from Salesforce, and finally creates a sales order by invoking a system API for SAP ERP.

### 3.2.3 How to Do It: Implement the Flogo App ###

In this lab, you'll create a process API that creates a quotation by making calls to the system API (Pricing Engine) and to salesforce using _Flogo Connector for Salesforce_. The address of first system API call is provided below. 


To implement the process API, do the following:

1. Navigate from the app **quotation_1_0_flogo_app** to the skeleton flow **postQuotation_POST**.

2. To enable data to flow between the trigger and the flow, you first need to map the trigger output to the flow input, and flow data to the trigger reply. Click on the ![Flogo Trigger](images/flogo_trigger.jpg) icon to open the configuration of the **ReceiveHTTPMessage** trigger.

3. Map the trigger output to the flow input as follows:

    ![Trigger Ouput](images/trigger_output.png)

4. Map the flow data to the trigger reply as follows:

    ![Trigger Reply](images/trigger_reply.png)

5. Close the trigger configuration screen, and move the **Return** tile at least 3 positions to the right. Create a first activity, by clicking on the left-most `+` and navigate through **General > Invoke REST Service**. Configure this activity as follows:

    1. Give it a name: **GetRate**.
    2. In the **Settings** section, specify the following fields:
